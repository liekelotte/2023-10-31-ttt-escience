## 🧊⛏️Icebreaker
### Exercise: Reviewing The Carpentries Experience and Goals

Have you ever participated in a Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry Workshop?

1.     Yes, I have taken a workshop. 
1.     Yes, I have been a workshop helper. XXXX
1.     Yes, I organized a workshop.
1.     No, but I am familiar with what is taught at a workshop. xxxXx
1.     No, and I am not familiar with what is taught at a workshop.  xx

Which of these most accurately describes your teaching experience?

1.     I have been a graduate or undergraduate teaching assistant for a university/college course. xxxxxxx
1.     I have not had any teaching experience in the past.x
1.     I have taught a seminar, workshop, or other short or informal course.xxxx
1.     I have been the primary or responsible teacher for a university/college course.xxx 
1.     I have taught at the primary or secondary education level. 
1.     I have taught informally through outreach programs, hackathons, libraries, laboratory demonstrations, and similar activities. XXxx

Why are you taking this course? What goals do you have for this training?

Lieke: I would like to learn more about live coding
Alex: I enjoy teaching programming and I want to learn how to do it better. My goal for this course is to feel confident about my skill to develop and hold a workshop session.
Xinyan: As a faculty data steward, I see many PhDs have high demand of taking digital skill training. Having basic teaching skills would be very helpful when provding training both wihtin the faculty or at the university 
Paolo: Training is a big passion of mine and I'd like to improve my teaching skills. 
Anton: I would like to improve my teaching skills, in particular using the methodologies used in the software carpentries.
Julian: I (Also!) enjoy teaching programming and would like to be better at it. I am part of the UVA Data science center who sometimes would like help with running carpentries workshops, and would like to help out.
Tom: I would like to gain more insight into how to convey content to student in a meaningful manner and improve presentation skills
Liliana: I wlould like to start teaching Data Carpentries in my faculty and make the laboratory data FAIR
Hal:  Ieining skills and get familiar with a proven pedagogical approachatr rovp
Özgün: I would like to start training sessions with the faculty for researchers and I want to improve my teaching skills and get inspired in different teaching philosophies.
Kim: For myself, to build upon my skills as a trainer; for DANS's Training Team, to see what elements of Carpentries we would implement in our own training design; for DANS, to be able to add to the NWO-i Carpentries team with me as a trainer
Jay: I want to learn how to teach people to code and geniunely interested in pedagogy for live coding.

## 🧠 Collaborative Notes & 🔧 Exercises

Kim: From the exercise on handling outcomes, and discussing formative assessment, when you have outcomes where there are mostly one of the wrong answers, then you need to revisit the concept; mostly right answers, you can still reiterate why it's the correct answer; an even spread of wrong answers indicates guesswork; no answer is still feedback, and likely indicates that you need to revisit the concept, or work with helpers and figure out who isn't submitting answers so that you can one-on-one see if there's anything that needs to be clarified.


### Exercise: Awareness gaps (5 minutes, CodiMd)

* Is there anything you are learning how to do right now? Can you identify something that you still need to think about, but your teacher can do without thinking about it?
* Think about the area of expertise you identified for yourself earlier. What could a potential awareness gap be?

Alex: Learning woodworking. My teacher quickly knows what type of wood and the direction of the grain. Then, she instantly knows which tool to use to get the best carving. I still can't do that. In my area of expertise, a potential awareness gap is the water engineering concepts I already know that some people from other faculties don't have. 
Xinyan:I am not good at cooking. When watching Youtube channels on making dishes, the person on the video might say somthing like 'add related sauses at suitable volumn, but somtimes it is difficult to know what the exact sause and its dose I should use.
Paolo: I am learning to be a data steward. I basically have to think about every step of the way because I'm afraid I won't get it right. Given that situation, I don't think I have an awareness gap in this area of expertise, but I do think I can become more mindless once my expertise starts to build.   
Anton: Learning Spanish. I mostly need to think a lot to use the right tense of a verb. 
Julian: After switching from a research role, I am having to learn new skills all the time and learn to think in terms of tech stacks and tools, whereeas a lot of the learning material I use assumes familiarity with what is available and when to address a problem with (for example) server side code vs. client side code etc. I think having worked with scientists for a while, I had something of an awareness gap when dealing with non-scientists, assuming that things like clean data vs complicated excel sheets would be obvious.
Tom: When operating machine tools, my father (who is a trained machinist) does not need to think about which direction to turn the handwheel to move the cutting tool, whereas I still need to stop and pause which direction of the handwheels will move the cutter in what way. Similarly, in version control, I have an immediate understanding of what commands affect the commit graph in what way, whereas new learners might not have that understanding if they are interfacing with the version control tool through a GUI program.
Liliana: learning to query large and complex datasets, I have to think about each step, whereas the trainer does it on the fly, effortlessly! Often, I assume people know the word seismic and carry on without realizing that using acoustic instead would make it easier to understand.
Özgün: I am learning cloud computing  - kubernetes, docker etc. In many videos I need to think about how is different from virtual environments. It was difficult to grasp the idea until I watched a good video explaining the difference. I am teaching machine learning to the architects. Often the potential awareness gap is about the background of the students. In some universities the students are quite good in programming and in others they are not so good. When the students do not have the background in programming it is hard to adopt the course. 

Hal: Learning Dutch, remebering het- and de- words. Native speakers don't think about this anymore. Also - in my hobby (analogue photography with sheet film view cameras), there is a huge awareness gap between expert practitioners and novices in remembering the order of operations necessary not to destroy expensive sheets of film :)
Kim: I'm in-between learning Dutch - I learned enough to take my A2 exams for Inburgering, and now I'm lacking the motivation to move to a higher level, and one of my "teachers" is my partner (Dutch) who can instantly give me the answer to the Dutch-language issue I'm having and not see where I'm making mistakes due to how close Dutch is to English (English is his second language that he learned in school, so a more formal approach to learning English than I am learning Dutch). As for expertise, I have expertise in disability and accessibility, and when I give training in it, I often pace the content in a way to make sure that the elements - that are so familiar to me from my own experience or years of training on this - have a moment to "sink in" for the learners to move on to the next level.
Jay: Recently started learning Dutch from scratch, and I still have problems in pronuncing 'G' and usage of het and de.

# Exercise: Sharing Feedback (25 min)
The prep time for this exercise is intentionally short – the point is to practice giving and receiving feedback, not to create a perfect presentation. Imperfect presentations will give you more to work with!

1. You will be split into breakout rooms with groups of three.
2. Individually, spend 5 minutes preparing a 90-second introduction to the topic of the lesson episode you chose before the start of the training course. You will not be live coding.
3. Get together with your group and have each person teach their segment to the group while one person records this (video and audio) using a cell phone or some other handheld device. Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person (one person should be responsible for the timekeeping).
4. After the first person finishes, rotate roles (they become the videographer, the audience becomes the instructor, and the person who was recording becomes the audience) and then rotate roles again.
7. After everyone in the group of three has finished teaching, watch the videos as a group. Everyone gives feedback on all three videos, i.e., people give feedback on themselves as well as on others. Keep an eye on the time during feedback, especially if your group has more than 3 people, to be sure to leave time for everyone.
8. After everyone has given feedback on all of the videos, return to the main group and put everyone’s feedback about you into the collaborative document.


## Homework

To prepare for our next session, please:

1.  Read about [centrally-organized and self-organized workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-organising) and our handbook content on [Teaching and Hosting Workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html) -- be sure to click through to some of the associated checklists. These summarize commonly asked questions about organizing and running workshops. When you arrive for the next part, we will ask you to add one question about our operations to a list. We will then do our best to answer all of those questions during the day.

2.  Prepare for the [live coding exercises](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/17-live.html). If you have not already done so per the pre-workshop instructions, pick an episode from an existing Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry lesson and read through it carefully.
    
In the next two parts, you will use this to practice live coding/participatory instruction for 3 minutes. Remember, imperfect presentations can generate useful feedback! If you have not yet selected an episode to focus on and would like a recommendation, consider one of the following:
    
*   Data Carpentry
*   [Faceting and Clustering in OpenRefine](https://datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/02-exploring-data/index.html)
*   [Basic Queries in SQL](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/01-sql-basic-queries)
*   [Starting with Data in R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html)
*   [Starting with Data in Python](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data)
