## 🧠 Collaborative Notes & 🔧 Exercises

### Exercise: Questions (5 min)
At the end of part 2, we asked you to read some resources about the logistics of teaching and running Carpentries workshops. Please add your questions about logistics and preparation to the Collaborative Document. We will answer these questions in the Collaborative Document during your work time and will return to this list later in the training. We may draw on the [Workshop FAQ](https://carpentries.org/workshop_faq/), which you can also refer to later if you have additional questions.

Read about [centrally-organized and self-organized workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-organising) and our handbook content on [Teaching and Hosting Workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html). 

Julian: The guidelines state that we have to teach the carpentries syllabus, how much scope is there for tweaking that syllabus depending on our own ideas or the type of audience we are teaching?
- Lieke: It depends on how attached you are to calling your workshop a Carpentries workshop - if you want it to be Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry or Library Carpentry and listed as such, there are rules about what should be included in the material you are teaching. However, since the materials are open source and CC licensed, you can use them to mix your own workshop. If you would a workshop your organised to be listed on the website, you can fill out this form: https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/. 

Kim: Q1 - listing workshops, for instance, this workshop/training isn't on the Carpentries website, but could be listed as private, so is it more a matter of convenience or is there a reason why it isn't listed (no shade, just curious); 
- Lieke: we made a "deal" with the Carpentries about this - usually instructor training is taught online and open to all Carpentries institutions. We prefer teaching in person (and participants usually do too). So we coordinate individually with local Carpentries coordinators to put together a Netherlands-only training for member institutes. The Carpentries are okay with that, and since it's not open to everyone (people cannot travel here easily), it's not advertised on the website. 

Q2 - how is instructor effort tracked - for instance, are ORCID IDs or similar attached to instructors so that their training can be linked to their academic/scholarly record? There is a mention of giving instructors credit for their (volunteer) effort, but is there a way that it can be tracked more easily/automatically?
- Lieke: This is tracked in AMY based on submitted workshop details. Once you have access to AMY, you can decide to share your ORCID with the Carpentries, and lesson contributions made with your GH account will be linked to your ORCID. The training itself, I am not sure about. 

Anton: How much can we deviate from the given material?
- Lieke: Hopefully that question was answered in the course today, but please let me know if you still have questions. See also the answer to Julian's question above. 

Thomas: I noticed some content in one of the episodes was somewhat outdated. What is the best way to address this/is there a way to have the content updated as to not to confuse learners?
- Lieke: Very good question. The lesson content is usually updated and instructors who notice this can make issues on the lesson repo (this also counts towards getting involved, so if you have an example, see if you can find an issue about it, and if not, make an issue! Or try and address it / submit a PR - this is a great way of helping the Carpentries). ALternatively there may be ways to deal with it in instructor notes. In the end the lessons are Community developed - so they rely on people like you to notice and update lesson material. 

Alexander: How much time and how many people does it take to organize a workshop? 
- Lieke: We will talk about this in the afternoon. Please let us know if you still have questions after this afternoon. 
Liliana: I would like to host a self-organized workshop to use domain specific data, is there any involvent of the Carpentries?
- Lieke: That's great! The only thing you should do is create a workshop website and submit your self-organised workshop [here](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/). 

Ozgun: Is it possible to add new content to the carpentries syllabus? Or when teaching a topic from the carpentries course should it be followed to word by word covering everything without any change?
- Lieke: I hope we have answered this question in class. Let us know if you have more questions.

Halford: Many (most?) of us are part of organisations that are affiliated with the Carpentries organisation / pay membership fees etc ... Can you clarify how the relationship works vis a vis our roles as institution affiliated people and as "Carpentries" trainers -- can we get involved in workshops other than through "work"? (Kind of relates to Kim's and Liliana's questions)
- Lieke: You can read more about how institutional membership works here: https://carpentries.org/membership/
- Your local Carpentries coordinator may know about other places looking for helpers / instructors. you can also post that you would like to be a helper on the topicbox page. 

Paolo: I don't have a question right now. I also think that my colleagues' questions already cover a lot of ground. 

Xinyan: What is the most effective way to coordinate between an instructor and helpers? For instance, when should the helpers raise common issues they've identified among the participants to the instructor?
- Lieke: For this reason, I believe it is good if there is a back channel through which you can communicate. When enough room is left by the instructor for questions (always leave a slightly longer pause than what feels comfortable), hopefully workshop participants bring up the question. If they do not, but a helper realises, they can use that moment to ask the question they believe a lot of learners to have

Jaykumar: While hosting an event or workshop, is it a thumb rule to have at least two instructors and one helper?
- Lieke: The Carpentries states the following in their [handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html): "We recommend 1 helper for every 8-10 students, not counting the two instructors." 
-

### Exercise: Be The Expert: Checkout Q & A (10 min)
1. In groups, read and discuss one of the three checkout procedures described on this page: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout.html Make notes in the Collaborative Doc.
2. What points do you think it is most important or helpful for people to remember?
3. What questions or points of confusion do you have, or think others might have?

#### Step 1: Welcome Session 
- It's a place for new instructors to ask their questions and hear everyone else's questions -- as well as the answers, of course.  
- It's a one-hour meeting that can be held online. 
- There is a welcome session in two weeks - November 13th. 
- You can register via Etherpad. 

#### Step 2: Teaching Demonstration

##### Important points
- Check the eligibility of the episode that you are going to be demo-ing (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demo_lessons)
- Online demo vs in-person - can feel different
- Double-checking time zones for the teaching demo and how it is going to affect your sign-up/set-up
- Preparing an episode rather than an entire lesson
- You are going to be asked to prepare a 5 minute segment of an episode
- Picking an episode in the middle means you should make sure that all the dependencies are prepared, but also knowing that the context of the previous lesson is there
- Feeling intimidated is a common feeling in the demonstration, so practicing in front of peers beforehand can be helpful

##### Questions or points of confusion
- Prepare a lesson or an episode? As of August 2023, you prepare an episode and will be demonstrating 5 minutes of material
- How am I being assessed? You assess yourself and then others will assess you (give feedback) and there is a rubric (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric) --> this includes how to deliver the material (typing vs copy-pasting) as well as the content (how close do you stick to the Carpentries material)
- Where do I find dates and times for training demos? Etherpad: https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos (pay attention to time zones and the number of slots available, as well as the post-signup requirements)

#### Step 3: Get Involved!

##### Important points
- The order of checkout doesn't matter - can get involved first then complete other steps
- Talk to institutional coordinator to help get involved
    
##### Points of confusion
- Contributing to lessons seemed overwhelming - seems almost like you need more training before attempting to contribute.
- Can contribute to some type of community progamming, but NL does not have a concrete carpentries community at the moment.

### Live coding feedback from groups

Paolo:
 - Presentation:
     - Tip: Increase the font size of the program. The pop-up note can be adressed so that it is not distractive.
     - Top: Explaining clearly and slowly what the software does. 
 - Content:
     - Tip: Having a smaller dataset or working plot could be useful.
     - Top: It was a simple guided exercise. Good introduction to a powerful program.

Alex:
 - Presentation:
     - Tip: Explain use of shortcuts.
     - Top: Pointing at parts of the code and explaining.
 - Content:
     - Tip: Turn off autocomplete; stick to structure.
     - Top: Shortly repeat previously discussed items; consistent use of terms.

Anton:
 - Presentation:
     - Tip: At some point you skipped explaining one of the commands. 
    - Top: Good speed. Explained each step very clearly. 
 - Content:
     - Tip: You showed a graph, but you didn't explain how we get there.  
     - Top: Reference to real-world problems. 


## Exercise: demos rubric (10 minutes)
Read the rubric that is given to Instructor Trainers for evaluating the online teaching demonstration sessions (Note: demos are not scored, so this rubric is for advisory purposes only): https://data-lessons.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/.  What questions do you have?

Alex
Xinyan
Paolo
Anton
Julian
Tom
Liliana
Özgün
Hal
Kim: when an assessment criteria is subjective (such as their focus on audience, etc), is this a point of discussion that could be revisited after the assessment (or how to appeal this if possible?)
Jay

## Exercise: Know your resources (10 minutes)

1) Take 5 minutes to read through the Code of Conduct Incident Response Guidelines: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html

2) Discuss what you have read with your neighbour. As questions arise, you may wish to refer to our complete Code of Conduct section in The Carpentries Handbook: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html or to the Transparency Reports released by The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee: https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/code-of-conduct-transparency-reports

What kinds of things could your instructional team agree upon in advance of your workshop?
What questions do you have about CoC enforcement?

3) Write some notes in the HackMD.

This discussion should take about 10 minutes.
